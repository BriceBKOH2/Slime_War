Name is a placeholder for now, the unit are cube for now, i may keep it in the future

Game idea revolse around two player competing around a board, managing a ressource (probably one that generates automaticly over time, same for each player) to create a spawn point on their side of the board that spawn a unit type they chose (more option and values = cost more) that will advance and fight on his way to the opposing player.
Challenge will be to first implement the game (obviously) and more so to balance the cost, option and values, like range, movement speed, damage, armor?, special abilities (movement, shield, ...) to keep it balance but more importantly interesting and fun
End game goal is to create an IA to play with, and learn from games if possible

TO DO LIST in order:
-Finish board construction and unit prefab (done if memory is correct)
-Create empty board on launch, generate unit on board on command (started, to be finished)
-Unit basic interaction : moving, then stopping when Unit is already on a tile, damage, death, respawn, player damage, end game
-Spawn point interaction
-Custom unit test
-Add ui to customize spawn point
-Add a spawn point library and saving library mechanic + adding custom point to library
-Add multiple library
-Add menu and special section for library
-Balance and playtest main phase
-Graphics + sound, custom color that player can choose for themselves or/and for each spawn point saved / customized
-Add network to play online via IP selection
-Lobby? server?
-game general improvement (graphics, sound, code efficency)
-IA !!
-enjoy
